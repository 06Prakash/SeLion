/**
 * This package hosts the custom {@link org.openqa.grid.selenium.GridLauncher} for SeLion.
 * This was essentially done to overcome some of the logging restrictions that {@link org.openqa.grid.selenium.GridLauncher}
 * imposes by ignoring the {@link java.util.logging.Logger} logging.properties file which can be passed in via the JVM argument.
