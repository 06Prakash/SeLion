  <h1 class="page-header">Customizing Yaml Page for iOS Native App automation</h1>

  <p>The section on <a href="#pageyaml">SeLion PageYaml</a> outlines details 
   on using Yaml for automating Web Flow. This section is focused on customizing SeLion Page Yaml to facilitate automation for
   iOS Native Apps.</p>
   
  <h2>Customized contents of a Yaml Page  </h2>

  <p>A Yaml page that represents page related information, would essentially have the below mentioned contents in
    it:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>baseClass</code> - The value for this key represents the fully qualified package name of a class that will
      serve as the base class from which
      all common abilities that any page in the SeLion world for a Native App would possess. If your page is totally new and is not
      customizing an existing page (for e.g., you may have a login page which perhaps extends a header page ), then you
      should be specifying the value for this key as <code>com.paypal.selion.testcomponents.IOSPage</code> because
      by default this is the class within SeLion that provides for all the basic operations that are associated with a
      given page, including logic pertaining to instantiation of the page as well.
    </li>
    <li><code>platform</code> - The value for this key represents the platform to which the data in the yaml file works for.
     By default, if nothing is specified it is taken as "web". For platforms like iOS it must be specified as "ios".
     </li>
    <li><code>elements</code> - The value for this key is a set of key/value pairs that represents the below information
      pertaining to html elements in the page.
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li> The name to be given to identifying the locator. This name would end up serving as the data member in the
        generated class which represents this element. The rules for naming the locator are as below :
        <ul>
          <li> &lt;prefix&gt;UIAButton Is a Button UI element.
          <li> &lt;prefix&gt;UIALink Is a Link UI element.
          <li> &lt;prefix&gt;UIANavigationBar Is a Navigation Bar UI element.
          <li> &lt;prefix&gt;UIASlider Is a Slider UI element.
          <li> &lt;prefix&gt;UIAImage Is a Image UI element.
          <li> &lt;prefix&gt;UIATextField Is a TextField UI element.
          <li> &lt;prefix&gt;UIAStaticText Is a Text UI element.   
        </ul>
        <p>Here <strong>prefix</strong> is a meaningful name that you
          would give to your element mapping it to the html element on
          your page.</p></li>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The UI element names are different for platforms.
         Ex: On a web platform its Button where as on a iOS Platform its UIAButton.The &lt;prefix&gt; must be followed by the element
         name as appropriate to the platform.</p>
        <p> The list of supported IOSeLionElement can be found here <a href="java-docs/codegen-apis/com/paypal/selion/elements/IOSSeLionElement.html">List of elements</a></p>  
      <li><code>locators:</code> - This key represents the set of values that map to the element name.</li>
      <li> values for the locators which represents a key/value pair of locale and the actual locator for the
        html element.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Here's how a sample yaml page for a native app can look like </h2>
  <pre data-src="../sample-files/yamlpage-nativeapp.yaml" class="language-markup"></pre>
  <p>Some important things to note here :</p>
  <ul>
   <li> <code>baseClass</code> value for the IOS Native app automation must be <code>com.paypal.selion.testcomponents.IOSPage</code></li>
   <li> <code>platform</code> value must be specified as <strong>ios</strong>. This value is mandatory, when not specified the default
   platform web is assumed.</li>
   <li> The suffix of all the elements must be a valid element name as per the platform. In the above yaml file a text area is represented
   using <code>UIAStaticText</code> and the element name is given as <code>sampleUIAStaticText</code> which is a valid one.
  </ul>
