  <p class="lead">This section is focused on SeLion PageYAML to facilitate automation for
    iOS apps. Concepts outlined in this section build on those described in <a href="#pageyaml">SeLion PageYAML for
    web flow</a>.</p>
   
  <h2>Contents of a PageYAML File</h2>

  <p>A PageYAML file that represents a page (or screen) in an iOS application is made up of the following parts.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>baseClass</code> - The value for this key represents the fully qualified package name of a class that will
      serve as the base class to inherit attributes and/or capabilities from. If your page is new and is not
      customizing an existing page (for example -- you may have a login page which extends a header page), then you
      should specify the value <code>com.paypal.selion.testcomponents.IOSPage</code> which
      by default is the class within SeLion that provides all the basic operations that are required for any given iOS page,
      including instantiation logic.
    </li>
    <li><code>platform</code> - The value for this key represents the platform the YAML is intended for.
     By default, if nothing is specified it is taken as "web". For platforms like iOS it must be specified as "ios".
     </li>
    <li><code>elements</code> - The value for this key is a set of key/value pairs that represent elements in a page.
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li> The name to be given to identifying the locator/selector. This name would end up serving as the data member in the
        generated class and maps to the element specified. The rules for naming locators/selectors are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li> &lt;prefix&gt;UIAButton Is a Button UI element.</li>
          <li> &lt;prefix&gt;UIALink Is a Link UI element.</li>
          <li> &lt;prefix&gt;UIANavigationBar Is a Navigation Bar UI element.</li>
          <li> &lt;prefix&gt;UIASlider Is a Slider UI element.</li>
          <li> &lt;prefix&gt;UIAImage Is a Image UI element.</li>
          <li> &lt;prefix&gt;UIATextField Is a TextField UI element.</li>
          <li> &lt;prefix&gt;UIAStaticText Is a Text UI element.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here <strong>prefix</strong> is a meaningful name that you
          would give to your element mapping it to the element on
          your page.</p></li>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Depending on the platform, UI element names are different. For example;
         On a web platform a button is located by <code>//button</code> and has a name with the word <code>Button</code> in it. On
          the iOS platform a button is located by <code>//UIAButton</code> and has a name with the word <code>UIAButton</code> in it.</p>
        <p>The list of supported iOS elements can be found <a href="java-docs/codegen-apis/com/paypal/selion/elements/IOSSeLionElement.html" alt="List of supported ios elements">here</a></p>
      <li><code>locators:</code> - This key represents the set of values that map to the element name.</li>
      <li><b>Localized locator</b> - Values for the locators/selectors which are comprised of a key/value pairs -- the locale the element will exist in and the
        actual locator/selector to find the element by. For example; <code>english: "//UIAStaticText[contains(@name,'climbed')]"</code>.
        This equates to -- For the english version of the app, there should exist a <code>UIAStaticText</code> element
        whose name contains <code>climbed</code> on the page/screen this file represents.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>An Example PageYAML File for an iOS application</h2>
  <pre data-src="../sample-files/yamlpage-nativeapp.yaml" class="language-markup"></pre>
  <p>Some important things to reiterate from this example:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><code>baseClass</code> value for the IOS Native app automation must be <code>com.paypal.selion.testcomponents.IOSPage</code> or a
    class which extends it.</li>
   <li><code>platform</code> value must be specified as <strong>ios</strong>. This value is mandatory. Otherwise, <a href="#pageyaml">web</a> is assumed.</li>
   <li> The suffix of all the elements must be a valid element name as per the platform. In the above YAML file a text area is represented
   using<code>UIAStaticText</code> and the element name is given as <code>sampleUIAStaticText</code> which is a valid one.</li>
  </ul>
