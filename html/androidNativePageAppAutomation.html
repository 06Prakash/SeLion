  <p class="lead">This section focuses on using SeLion generated page objects for interacting with a mobile specific 
     application on the Android platform. Make sure you understand the content from the section 
     <a href="#android-native-page-yaml">SeLion PageYAML for Android Apps</a> first.
    <ul>
    <li> The YAML file used by the below <code>@Test</code> method should be added to the path 
         <em>src/main/resources/GUIData/</em> with name <strong>NativeAppTestPage.yaml</strong>. 
         It should have the following content:
      <pre data-src="../sample-files/yamlpage-androidnativeapp.yaml" class="language-markup"></pre>
    </li>
    <li>First the <code>@Test</code> annotated method needs to also be annotated with <code>@MobileTest</code>.
      This indicates to SeLion that the <code>@Test</code> code will be performed against a mobile device or emulator.</li>
    <li>A typical test would look like this:
      <pre data-src="../sample-files/androidnativeapp-pageobject.java"></pre>
    </li>
    </ul>   
  
  <p> Refer to <a href="#getting-started-mobile">Native App automation with SeLion</a> for additional details including
