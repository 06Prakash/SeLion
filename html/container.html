  <h1 class="page-header">Introducing the Container Element in
    SeLion</h1>
  <p class="lead">A Container element is used to hold one or more of the other html elements. Some of
    the examples of containers are the <code>span</code>, <code>div</code>, or
    <code>tr</code> elements</p>
  <!--<h2>Why Container Elements?</h2>-->
  <!--<p>Container elements are useful when the same set of html elements are encompassed in different containers-->
    <!--and iterating over them does not need one to change the entire XPATH but merely by switching containers the elements-->
    <!--can be accessed.</p>-->
  <h2>Container Element Format</h2>
  <p>The YAML declaration for a typical container element would look like the sample below. To learn more about YAML and
      SeLion, refer to the section -- <a href="#pageyaml">What is a YAML page in the SeLion world</a>.</p>
  <pre data-src="../sample-files/container-sample1.yaml" class="language-markup"></pre>
  <p>Here we are stating :</p>
    <ul>
    <li>We would like to define a Container element in SeLion and we would like to be calling it as
      <code>bankContainer</code>.</li>
    <li>This container element can be identified using the css locator
      <code>css=.fundingSources.banks .fundingSource:not(.ghost)</code> for the locale <code>english</code>.
      You can add more locales if there is a need.</li>
    <li>This container element has the below elements contained in it:
      <ol>
        <li>A label which we would like to name as <code>bankNameLabel</code> and which can be located using the
          css locator  <code>css=[class*=cardName]</code> for the locale <code>english</code></li>
        <li>A label which we would like to name as <code>bankTypeLabel</code> and which can be located using
          the css locator <code>css=[class*=type]</code> for the locale <code>english</code></li>
        <li>A label which we would like to name as <code>bankLast4DigitsLabel</code> and which can be located
          using the css locator <code>css=[class*=lastDigits]</code> for the locale <code>english</code></li>
        <li>A link which we would like to name as <code>bankLink</code> and which can be located using the css
          locator <code>css=a</code> for the locale <code>english</code></li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When we generate the actual Page class using the <a href="#what-is-code-generator">SeLion Code generator
        Maven plugin</a> the generated code would look like the sample below:</p>
      <p style="text-decoration: underline">A Sample YAML page:</p>
      <pre data-src="../sample-files/container-sample2.yaml" class="language-markup"></pre>
      <p style="text-decoration: underline">The SeLion Code Generator will create the following:</p>
      <pre data-src="../sample-files/container-sample3.java"></pre>
      <p>As you can see, the SeLion Code Generator Maven plugin constructed a sub class
        named <code>BankContainer</code> for the SeLion element <code>Container</code> and also added all the required
        code that is now going to help us interact with the elements that are contained within.</p></li>

    <h2>Rules for Using Containers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The name of the container element should end with the text <code>Container</code>. This
        is how SeLion identifies the type of an element when it resorts to generating actual java classes in Runtime.</li>
      <li>Nesting of containers is <b>NOT</b> allowed. You cannot embed one container within the other.</li>
    </ul>
