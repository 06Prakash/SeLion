    How to hook into events generated by WebDriver using SeLion.
  </p>

  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    WebDriver events are primarily those events which are related to some action that Selenium WebDriver performs on
    the web page or on a native application such as "click" (or) "type" etc., Selenium's answer to hooking into such
    events is via
    <a
      href="https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/support/events/EventFiringWebDriver.html">
      <code>EventFiringWebDriver</code></a>.
    However, there are a couple of issues with using <code>EventFiringWebDriver</code>.
    <ol>
      <li>It does not work with
        <a href="https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/interactions/Actions.html">Actions</a>
      </li>
      <li>The Selenium dev community is likely to deprecate this class out of the core libraries and perhaps relocate it
        to a different project -- possibly also in a different form.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started with Event Handling in SeLion</h2>

  <p>
    SeLion offers support to hook into events that are generated by WebDriver (including the ones that originate from
    the <code>Actions</code> class) in a different way. These steps can be followed to start hooking into
    WebDriver events using SeLion.
    <ol>
      <li>Create a new listener class by implementing the SeLion exposed interface
        <code>com.paypal.selion.platform.grid.EventListener</code>.
        <pre data-src="../sample-files/MyEventListener.java"></pre>
      </li>
      <li>Provide the fully qualified class name of your listener via one of the following ways:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The JVM argument <code>SELION_SELENIUM_WEBDRIVER_EVENT_LISTENER</code>
          <pre><code class="language-sh">-DSELION_SELENIUM_WEBDRIVER_EVENT_LISTENER=qa.tests.MyEventListener</code></pre></li>
        <li>As a TestNG suite file parameter <code>webDriverEventListener</code>.
          <pre data-src="../sample-files/events-sample1.xml"></pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
      If you have more than one listener that you would want to plug into, then provide them as comma separated values.
    </ol>
    With that you should now start being able to start hooking into all events that originate from concrete
    implementations of <code>WebDriver</code>. The javadocs for
    <a href="https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/remote/DriverCommand.html"><code>DriverCommand</code></a>
    is a good place to start learning all commands supported by <code>WebDriver</code>.
