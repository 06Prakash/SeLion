    Make sure you understand the content from the section <a href="#nativepageyaml">SeLion PageYaml for iOS Apps</a> first.
    <ul>
    <li> The YAML file used by the below <code>@Test</code> method would look like the following and it's content would
      reside in a file named <b>NativeAppTestPage.yaml</b>
      <pre data-src="../sample-files/yamlpage-nativeapp.yaml" class="language-markup"></pre>
    </li>
    <li>First the <code>@Test</code> annotated method needs to also be annotated with <code>@MobileTest</code>.
      This indicates to SeLion that the <code>@Test</code> code will be performed against a mobile device or emulator.</li>
    <li>A typical test would look like this;
      <pre data-src="../sample-files/nativeapp-pageobject.java"></pre>
    </li>
    </ul>
