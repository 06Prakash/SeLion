<h2>iOS Native App automation using SeLion PageObject Model</h2>
  <p>Before using the PageObject Model for automating iOS Native Apps please refer <a href="#nativepageyaml">SeLion PageYaml For Native App</a>.
     Once the yaml file is customized as mentioned in the previous link , we are all set to use the page generated for automation purpose.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>First the <code>@Test</code> annotated test method needs to be annotated additionally with the annotation <code>@MobileTest</code>. This basically indicates to SeLion that an iOS simulator needs to be spawned before hand and kept ready.</li>
      <li> The Yaml file used by the test would look like below. <strong>Note:</strong> The yaml file name is NativeAppTestPage.yaml
      <pre data-src="../sample-files/yamlpage-nativeapp.yaml" class="language-markup"></pre>
    </li>
    <li>A typical test would look like below
      <pre data-src="../sample-files/nativeapp-pageobject.java"></pre>
    </li>
    </ul>   
  
  <p> Refer <a href="#getting-started-mobile">Native App automation with SeLion</a> for details on parameters and also the different ways of passing the parameters with respect to Native app automation.
