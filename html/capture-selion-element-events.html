    How to hook into element events provided by SeLion.

  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    SeLion element events are those which are related to some element interaction, such as a "click", a "select", etc performed
    through an element object included with SeLion.

  <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started with Element Event Handling in SeLion</h2>

  <p>
    SeLion offers support to hook into events that are triggered by SeLion elements. These steps can be followed to hook into
    a SeLion element event. As an example we are going to create a <code>DebugScreenshotListener</code> which takes a screenshot
    and adds it to the report before any element is clicked on.
    <ol>
      <li>Create a new listener class by implementing the SeLion exposed interface
        <code>ElementEventListener</code>. Or extend the <code>AbstractElementEventListener</code> if you don't want to implement all methods.
        <pre data-src="../sample-files/MyElementEventListener.java"></pre>
      </li>
      <li>Provide the fully qualified class name of your listener via one of the following ways:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The JVM argument <code>SELION_ELEMENENT_EVENT_LISTENER</code>
          <pre><code class="language-sh">-DSELION_ELEMENT_EVENT_LISTENER=com.paypal.test.listeners.DebugScreenshotListener</code></pre></li>
        <li>As a TestNG suite file parameter <code>elementEventListener</code>.
          <pre data-src="../sample-files/events-sample2.xml"></pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
      If you have more than one listener that you would want to plug in, then provide them as comma separated values.
    </ol>
  </p>
