  <h1 class="page-header">SeLion PageYaml</h1>

  <p class="lead">YAML pages in the SeLion world are equivalent to object repositories. They help in abstracting away all
    of the locator information, the location strategy to be used to identify an element, the challenges with handling
    localization etc., and help keep the test code clean.</p>
  <p>They contain the following information with respect to a given
    page and represent a particular page as an Object, so that test code can leverage them to interact with
    the specific page. </p>
  <ul>
    <li> The Java class from which the newly generated page should extend itself from.
    <li> The title of the page
    <li> The set of elements, the ways of locating them (lets call this as locating strategies) and the actual locators
      themselves.
    <li> A set of validators that can be used to trigger validations on a given page once it is loaded as a result of an
      operation on the page.
  </ul>
  <h2>PageYaml Contents</h2>

  <p>A YAML page that represents page related information, would essentially have the below mentioned contents in
    it:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>baseClass</code> - The value for this key represents the fully qualified package name of a class that will
      serve as the base class from which
      all common abilities that any page in the SeLion world would possess. If your page is totally new and is not
      customizing an existing page (for example, a login page which extends a header page ), then you
      should be specifying the value for this key as <code>com.paypal.selion.testcomponents.BasicPageImpl</code> because
      by default this is the class within SeLion that provides for all the basic operations that are associated with a
      given page, including logic pertaining to instantiation of the page as well.
    </li>
    <li><code>pageTitle</code> - The value for this key is a set of key/value pairs wherein you would like to capture
      the page titles for various different combinations (locales, for example).
    </li>
    <li><code>elements</code> - The value for this key is a set of key/value pairs that represents the below information
      pertaining to html elements in the page.
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li> The name to be given to identifying the locator. This name would end up serving as the data member in the
        generated class which represents this element. The rules for naming the locator are as below :
        <ul>
          <li> <var>&lt;prefix&gt;</var>Button Is a Button html element.
          <li> <var>&lt;prefix&gt;</var>CheckBox Is a Check Box html element.
          <li> <var>&lt;prefix&gt;</var>DatePicker Is a Date Picker html element.
          <li> <var>&lt;prefix&gt;</var>Form Is a Form html element.
          <li> <var>&lt;prefix&gt;</var>Image Is a Image html element.
          <li> <var>&lt;prefix&gt;</var>Label Is a Label html element.
          <li> <var>&lt;prefix&gt;</var>Link Is a Link html element.
          <li> <var>&lt;prefix&gt;</var>RadioButton Is a Radio Button html element.
          <li> <var>&lt;prefix&gt;</var>List Is a Select List html element.
          <li> <var>&lt;prefix&gt;</var>Table Is a Table html element.
          <li> <var>&lt;prefix&gt;</var>TextField Is a Text Field html element.
          <li> <var>&lt;prefix&gt;</var>Container Is a Container html element.
        </ul>
        <p>Here <strong><var>prefix</var></strong> is a meaningful name that you
          would give to your element, mapping it to the html element on
          the page.</p></li>
      <li><code>locators:</code> - This key represents the set of values that map to the element name.</li>
      <li><b>Locator</b> - Values for the locators which represents a key/value pair of locale and the actual locator for the
        html element. Example: <code>US: "//div[@id='apiOption1']/p[3]/a"</code>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <h2>An Example PageYaml File</h2>
  <pre data-src="../sample-files/yamlpage-sample1.yaml" class="language-markup"></pre>
  <p>Some important things to note here:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Notice how all the elements end with type of the element that we already mentioned.</li>
    <li>For example, if we consider <code>addOrEditAPIPermissionsLink</code> you will notice that we are giving a
      meaningful name to this link i.e., this is the link that is representing a href on the page which is going to add
      or edit api permissions.
    </li>
    <li>The keys <code>US</code>, <code>FR</code> represents the locales. This is how we create YAML pages for pages
      that involve localization.
    </li>
    <li>For the element <code>requestAPICredentialsLink</code> the locator <code>"//a[contains(@href,
      'cmd=_profile-api-add-direct-access')]|//a[contains(@href, 'cmd=%5fprofile%2dapi%2dadd%2ddirect%2daccess')]</code>
      has a <b>|</b> (pipe symbol) in it. Pipe symbols are used in SeLion to signify an <b>OR</b> operator
      which means that this particular link can either be found using the xpath <code>//a[contains(@href,
        'cmd=_profile-api-add-direct-access')]</code> <b>or</b> using the xpath <code>//a[contains(@href,
        'cmd=%5fprofile%2dapi%2dadd%2ddirect%2daccess')]</code></li>
    <li>Notice that only for the element <code>requestAPICredentialsLink</code> we are having locators for 2 locales
      viz., <b>US</b> and <b>FR</b>. This is another salient feature of SeLion. For specific elements alone you can have
      locators defined for specific locales. So for the same locale say <b>FR</b> since the element <code>viewAPICertificateLink</code>
      doesn't have a locator for <b>FR</b> SeLion will default to using the locator specified for the locale <b>US</b>
      while working with the country <b>FR</b>.
    </li>
    <li>The element <code>pageValidators</code> contain the list of elements that are supposed to be
      validated when your test performs a <code>click(Object..)</code> (or) <code>clickAndExpectOneOf(Object..)</code>
      operation on a page. The validations are one of the following :
      <ul>
        <li><code>isPresent</code> - This is the default validation that is run on an element if nothing is specified.
        </li>
        <li><code>isVisible</code></li>
        <li><code>isEnabled</code></li>
      </ul>
      So from our above example, SeLion checks if the element represented by
      <code>grantAPIPermissionLink</code> is <code>visible</code> because we explicitly requested for that validation.
      It would also check if the element represented by <code>viewAPISignatureLink</code> is <b>present</b> or not.
      If you do not wish to include any validators, you can leave it empty <code>[]</code></li>
    <li>We also have a special kind of an element called <code>headerContainer</code>. To read more about Container
      elements please take a look <a href="#containers">Introducing the Container Element</a> page.
    </li>

  </ul>
